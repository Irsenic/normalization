Normalization is important for scaling the features of a dataset on a global scale. So here, implementation of normalization through three different scales have been carried out like min-max scaling, max-absolute scaling and robust scaling using scikit-learn.

the, accuracy scores were calculated using Logistic-Regression method in order to determine which of the following scales was appropriate.
